# Bird species

This repository should include the majority if not all existing, and extinct, species of the aves class (birds) divided into their individual orders, families, genera, and species.
Currently I have 10,955 different species, although all of this is scraped from the internet, I have not been able to verify any errors other than obvious errors.

You are obviously free to use the data for any purpose you may like, if you have any contributions, whether it's modifications or additions, you should be able to create such request.
